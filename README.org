dotfiles repo. Also houses its updater script for now.

The updater script is very unfinished and will not get its own repo
until some things I consider essential are in place; ditto the man page
helper.

*Subject to breaking changes without warning*. If you do want to use it
yourself in its current form, I'd simply download the whole source tree
(=repo-update/=) and chuck it wherever, for now. Packaging won't happen
for a while, if ever.

* TODO

** Main list
/Roughly/ in order of priority:

- [ ] getopts -> getopt
- [ ] Add a function to check the error arrays at the end of all runs
- [ ] (Maybe) Implement a small error stack just in case it becom
  untrivial later
- [ ] Decide what needs refactoring into a settings file
- [ ] Write newer/older check for copy ops
- [ ] Allow set/unset/get settings through optstrings
  - /Which?/ Verbosity; summary/-ies; ?
    - [ ] Set defaults for some/all unset?
- [ ] Write a good-enough menu for 'interactive'-mode
- [ ] Allow multiple inclusion sources
  - [ ] Nested list input handling (i.e "per-app" lists and dir trees)
- [X] Rewrite pre-op file checks
  - [ ] Time first or diff first?
  - [ ] Ask whether to proceed if not all sources could be verified
    - /With flag; default off?/
    - [ ] Add to user settings when that's working
- [ ] Rename and fork off updater & man generator
- [ ] Allow error verbosity levels
  - [ ] Rework after 'proper' arg parsing is implemented
- [ ] Allow saving existing target root as =dir.old/=
  - Allow setting for gzip if repo is large enough to warrant
    compression?
- [ ] Let user keep a machine/account-local ignore file that matches
  against the include list, suppressing warnings about those files not
  being on the local machine
- [ ] Do =pushd= & =popd= on start and end of run
  - Try to find out if it'll ever be necessary first. /Upd.:/ Probably
    not :)
- [X] Main copy ops

--------------

** Implemented, needing additions
**** Write help string(s)
- [X] Sort out the 'real' globals in =functions.sh=. Some should be made
  /actually/ global to the main runner
