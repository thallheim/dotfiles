dotfiles repo. Also houses its updater script for now.

The updater script is very unfinished and will not get its own repo
until some things I consider essential are in place; ditto the man page
helper.

*Subject to breaking changes without warning*. If you do want to use it
yourself in its current form, I'd simply download the whole source tree
(=repo-update/=) and chuck it wherever, for now. Packaging won't happen
for a while, if ever.

* TODOs

** Main list [3/17]

- [ ] Add --force flag to clobber if repo file is newer than src
- [ ] Rewrite pre-op file checks
  - [ ] Offer to diff? How to handle multiple files?
  - [ ] Ask whether to proceed if not all sources could be verified
    - /With flag; default off?/
    - [ ] Add to user settings when that's working
- [ ] Move dir exist check from copy_all() -> mk_dst_dirs()
- [ ] Add a function to check the error arrays at the end of all runs
- [ ] Automate updating man-page source & generating a new one
- [ ] Decide what needs refactoring into a settings file
- [ ] Split  ~mk_dst_dirs()~ so ~-t~ can check dst paths are valid, sans mkdir-ing
- [ ] Allow set/unset/get settings through optstrings
  - /Which?/ Verbosity; summary/-ies; ?
    - [ ] Set defaults for some/all unset?
- [-] Write a good-enough menu for 'interactive'-mode
- [ ] Allow multiple inclusion sources
  - [ ] Nested list input handling (i.e "per-app" lists and dir trees)
- [ ] (Maybe) Implement a small error stack just in case it becomes untrivial
  later
- [ ] Rename and fork off updater & man generator
- [ ] Allow error verbosity levels
  - Rework after 'proper' arg parsing is implemented
- [ ] Allow saving existing target root as =dir.old/=
  - Allow setting for gzip if repo is large enough to warrant compression?
- [ ] Let user keep a machine/account-local ignore file that matches
  against the include list, suppressing warnings about those files not
  being on the local machine
- [ ] Do =pushd= & =popd= on start and end of run
  - Try to find out if it'll ever be necessary first. /Upd.:/ Probably
    not :)
--------------
- [X] Main copy ops
- [X] Make verbose mode flag order-agnostic
- [X] Write newer/older check for copy ops
